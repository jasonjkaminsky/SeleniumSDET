Selenium Class 12

POM - Page Object Model
is a design pattern which allows us to enhance the maintenance and reduce code duplication

Advantages of POM:
1. Code reusability
2. Code maintainability
3. Object repository
4. Readability

How to Implement:
1. POM without PageFactory
2. POM with PageFactory
